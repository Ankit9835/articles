HTML stands for Hyper text markup language which is used to create websites. We can say HTML is the foundation of any websites.

Using Only HTML we can create website excluding design parts and functionality.

For making the foundation of a website we can use various types of HTML elements for any users, some of these are - 

1) Heading Tag 

       <h1></h1>

       Heading Tag is mainly used for writing any word,sentence with a different font sizes with bold styles also.
       Heading tag comes with <h1> to <h6> font size depends on the heading tag we are using.

2) Paragraph

        <p></p>

        This tag in HTML defines a paragraph. When we look at the webpage, 
        we see that there are few spaces added before and after a paragraph.
        HTML does this by default.By default the <p> tag is set to block we can change its styles using CSS.
        display property added next paragraph to the next line.

3) Image

      <img src='' alt='' width='' height='' decoding='' fetchpriority='' loading=''>

      With the help of <img> tag and with the above attributes we can show the image on the browser.

      'src' attributes takes a correct path of file if path matched then it showed the image on to the browser.

    'alt' if in src attributes file path is incorrect then whatever we write into the alt    attribute it shows it to us.

    'width' it sets the width of an image using pixels.

    'height' it sets the height of an image using pixels.

    'decoding' provides an image decoding hint to the browser. 
    some of the values are . sync - decode the image synchronously,
     for atomic presentation with other content. . async - decode the image asynchronously, 
     to reduce delay in presenting other content.

 'fetchpriority' provides a hint of the relative priority to use when fetching the image,it will be high,low,auto

 'loading' it indicates how the browser should load the image,it will be of two types eager,lazy.
  in eager images load immediately it does not care that the image is within the visible port 
  or not and in lazy loading load the image until it reaches to the viewport.
